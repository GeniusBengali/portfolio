# JSON Database for Portfolio Website

This repository serves as a JSON database for my portfolio website, which is hosted at [w3spaces](https://ajrishad.w3spaces.com). The JSON data stored here is used to populate and update content on my website dynamically.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to store structured data in JSON format, which can be easily accessed and consumed by my website using JavaScript. By separating the data from the frontend code, I can update and maintain my website's content without making changes to the code itself.

## How It Works

- **Data Files**: JSON data files are organized within this repository, containing various types of information such as project details, blog posts, or any other relevant content.

- **Website Integration**: My portfolio website utilizes JavaScript to fetch and parse this JSON data, allowing for dynamic content generation. This integration ensures that my website always displays up-to-date information.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal database for my portfolio website, contributions and suggestions are welcome. If you have ideas for improvements or would like to report issues related to the data, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
